# Pseudo code
#
# NN module
#
# Camera module will instantiate a NN module.
# Camera then will pass an image to the instantiated class.
# Ie:
# NN = new NNModule()
#
# while(true):
#     img = getImage()
#     NN.anaylyze(img)
#     wait 1 second


# When we are called, we will do the following

#Constructor:
#   Initialize the NN, set up any variables


#def analyze(img):
#   This runs the analysis code from example
